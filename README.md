# gamingHackathon
Hey, Reneverse team
- I have deployed my game as webgl make sure you have unity server to play otherwise it will not run on browser.
- I have included two games(one with and without authorization of user id) so that you can play my game.
- All the assets are integrated and minted in the ReneVerse website as per video guidance.
- Please have look at my game. I am an indie game developer and looking for an opportunity in the gaming world.
- Thank you.
